# Store-App


### In this task, I will build a store application using React for the frontend and Express for the backend. I will set up an Express server to handle API requests and define endpoints to fetch product data from the Fake Store API. The React frontend will make requests to the Express backend to retrieve and display the product data on the Home page. This setup will ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend, providing a seamless user experience.
